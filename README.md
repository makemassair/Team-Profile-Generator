## About
Using object-oriented programming (OOP), Node.js, JavaScript, and NPM packages, I've written a **Team Profile Generator** that following command-line prompts will produce a simple HTML page with the recorded input. It contains input validation to ensure that numbers are entered where required. It also validates to ensure email addresses are correct. This project has built on the README generator I created on my [last module](https://makemassair.github.io/readme-generator-nodejs).

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
To generate the HTML file, run `node index.js` in the command-line at the root of this app. Follow the prompts, and when you have finished adding your team members, visit the `/output` folder location to access your `team.html`.
